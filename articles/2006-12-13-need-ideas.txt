I've got this awesome blog to keep up with, and although there are a bunch of things I know I could be putting on here, but I need ideas from the people.  My little site isn't frequented that much, but that's fine with me, I would like to see it grow and become a great resource.

Anyone that has ideas, feel free to let me know, shoot me an email at amdtech@mdaniel.net and I'll write about it.  Also, I may be looking for people to keep the blog updated as well with their experiences and ideas so there's more information from other people.

Thanks :) Your friendly neighborhood Asterisk guy
